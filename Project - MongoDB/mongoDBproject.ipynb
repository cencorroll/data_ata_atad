    "Based on the collection thats being created, there is a one to many relationship between customers and orders. There is also a one to many relationship between orders and products. I have specified the collection objects this way because I think querying will be easier with less nested keys. My original plan was to have customers as the collection with the other fields being nested within but I think the cases of querying based on the customer not being the subject are unlikely. For example I can look for how many orders a specific customer has but I am less likely to ask how many customers one order has.\n",

This seemed redundant and so I thought it was better to have one order with one customer and multiple products."
